# Alve.Json

A simple F# library for decoding and encoding JSON values, inspired by Elm's Json.Decode.

## Installation

TODO

## Usage

See `Alve.Json.Tests/DecodeTests.fs` for examples of using this library. Also, it closely matches Elm's [Json.Decode](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Json-Decode), so to get a general idea, you can look at the docs for that.
